# Akasa (आकाश)

![CI](https://github.com/akasamq/akasa/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

English | [简体中文](README-CN.md) 

Akasa is a high performance, low latency and high extendable MQTT server in Rust.

The underlying MQTT protocol message codec ([mqtt-proto][mqtt-proto]) is carefully crafted for high performance and async environment.

## Features
- [x] Full support MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1/v5.0
- [x] Support TLS (include two-way authentication)
- [x] Support WebSocket (include TLS support)
- [x] Support [Proxy Protocol V2][proxy-protocol]
- [x] Use a [Hook trait][hook-trait] to extend the server
- [x] Simple password file based authentication
- [x] JWT authentication with secrets file
- [ ] Cluster mode (*coming soon*)

## How to Use

The easist way is use docker:
```shell
docker run --init -it --rm -p 1883:1883 -v "$HOME/local/etc":/opt thewawar/akasa:0.1.1 akasa start --config /opt/akasa-config.yaml
```

Or build from source:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/akasamq/akasa.git && cd akasa
# You may also need to install openssl: https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/#automatic
cargo build --release

./target/release/akasa --help
# Commands:
#  start            Start the server
#  default-config   Generate default config to stdout
#  insert-password  Insert a password to the password file
#  remove-password  Remove a password from the password file
#  jwt-gen          Generate jwt token
#  help             Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

## Testing
Testing is very important for reliable software. Akasa currently include 100+ test cases, those test cases are collected by reading the specification and catch the functional points and limitations.

The underlying codec ([mqtt-proto][mqtt-proto]) also include significant amount of test cases and also some [fuzz][mqtt-proto-fuzz] testing.

## Enterprise Edition

Akasa will have an enterprise edition. In this edition, it provides:

- [x] WebAssembly based Rule Engine
  * can run very complex logic (such as [TensorFlow][tensorflow])
  * very high performance compare to scripting language
  * hot reload
- [ ] HTTP API to interact with Akasa
- [ ] Statistics metrics
- [ ] Rate limit
- [ ] Data Integration (route message to MySQL/Kafka/InfluxDB...)
